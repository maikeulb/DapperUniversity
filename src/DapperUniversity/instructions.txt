If you have docker installed,
1. docker-compose build
2. docker-compose up
2. Go to http://localhost:8000

If you don't have docker installed then you need flway and PostgreSQL. If you
meet those requirements, then you need to configure flyway.conf and
appsettings.Development.json so that they point to your DB.

1. cd ./Migrations flyway migrate
2. dotnet restore
2. dotnet ef database update
3. dotnet run
4. Go to http://localhost:5000
