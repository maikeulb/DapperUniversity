If you have docker installed,
1. docker-compose build
2. docker-compose up

If you don't have docker installed then you need flway and PostgreSQL. If you
meet those requirements, then you need to configure flyway.conf and
appsettings.Development.json so that they point to your DB.

1. cd ./Migrations flyway migrate
2. dotnet restore
3. dotnet run
